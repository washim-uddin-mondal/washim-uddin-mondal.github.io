                    <p>               
                        I obtained my Ph. D. degree from G. S. Sanyal School of Telecommunications, 
                        Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur where I worked under the guidance of Prof. Goutam Das. 
                        In July 2018, I was awarded  the Prime Minister's 
                        Research Fellowship (PMRF) for the rest of my Ph. D. tenure. In its commencement
                        batch in 2018, only 138 students were nationally selected for this prestigious fellowship via a rigorous interview process.

                        
                        My primary research focus was on the development of economic models for wireless and wired networked systems.
                        I borrowed tools from game theory, optimization and mechanism design to achieve that goal.
                        In Dec 2020, the PMRF evaluation committee assessed my thesis to be of excellent quality. I am fortunate to be one of
                        the very few PMR fellows that have been invited to present their works at the first

                        At the end of 10th semester, my cumulative grade point average (CGPA) was 9.51 on a 10 point scale.
