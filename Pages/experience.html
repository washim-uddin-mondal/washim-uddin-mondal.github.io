                        I was a post-doctoral researcher at the Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA where I was working
                        at the intersection of Machine Learning, Game Theory and Networked systems under the guidance of <a href="http://www.satishukkusuri.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Satish V. Ukkusuri</a> of Lyles School of Civil Engineering and  
                        <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/CLANLabs" target="_blank">Prof. Vaneet Aggarwal</a> of School of Industrial Engineering.

                        My works were primarily on the theoretical aspects of reinforcement learning (i.e., finding optimal regret, sample complexity, etc.) and their application in transportation networks, social networks 
                        and disaster recovery systems. This fruitful collaboration resulted in a lot of publications in prestigious venues such as IEEE Transactions, JMLR, AAAI, AISTATS, etc. <a href="./conferencePublications.html">One of our works</a> was awarded the best paper award at the 
                        Cooperative AI workshop at NeurIPS 2021.

                        I was specially invited by the Directorate General of Signal Intelligence, 
                        Indian Army to solve a problem of national importance. The problem was 
                        solved within one week with deliverable output. The developed product is currently
                        being used by the Signal Intelligence division of Indian Army and according to their report,
                        it is helping them to save the lives of countless soldiers throughout the country.

                <p>
                    After graduating from college, I worked for a few months as a quantitative
                    researcher at WorldQuant LLC where, as a part of the algorithmic trading team,
                    my responsibility was to develop algorithms, also called Alphas, 
                    that can be used to build profitable trading strategies in stock markets.
                    This brief exposure to the trading industry helped me realise that
                    my true calling is in research and academia.

                    In the summer of 2014, I was fortunate enough to work under the guidance of 
                    Prof. Tobias J. Kippenberg at the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/k-lab/" target="_blank">Laboratory of Photonics and Quantum Measurements</a>.
                    I developed a framework for simulating different optical properties of
